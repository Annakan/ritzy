[[contents]]
== Contents

The content of the editor can be retrieved by one of the following methods:

====
https://github.com/ritzyed/ritzy/blob/master/src/ritzy.js#L261[Ritzy.getContents]::
Returns the contents of the editor as an array of Char objects. The Char object is from the
underlying CRDT data store.
====

====
https://github.com/ritzyed/ritzy/blob/master/src/ritzy.js#L271[Ritzy.getContentsRich]::
Returns the contents of the editor in a rich text JSON format representing the rich text chunks and the
associated attributes.
====

====
https://github.com/ritzyed/ritzy/blob/master/src/ritzy.js#L280[Ritzy.getContentsHtml]::
Returns the contents of the editor as HTML.
====

====
https://github.com/ritzyed/ritzy/blob/master/src/ritzy.js#L289[Ritzy.getContentsText]::
Returns the contents of the editor as plain text.
====

[[selection]]
== Selection

The current selection can be retrieved by one of the following methods:

====
https://github.com/ritzyed/ritzy/blob/master/src/ritzy.js#L301[Ritzy.getSelection]::
Returns the contents of the current selection as an array of Char objects. The Char object is from the
underlying CRDT data store.
Returns the contents of the current selection in the underlying CRDT data storage format. The left char
of the selection is exclusive and the right char is inclusive.
====

====
https://github.com/ritzyed/ritzy/blob/master/src/ritzy.js#L311[Ritzy.getSelectionRich]::
Returns the contents of the current selection in a rich text JSON format representing the rich text chunks
and the associated attributes.
====

====
https://github.com/ritzyed/ritzy/blob/master/src/ritzy.js#L320[Ritzy.getSelectionHtml]::
Returns the contents of the current selection as HTML.
====

====
https://github.com/ritzyed/ritzy/blob/master/src/ritzy.js#L329[Ritzy.getSelectionText]::
Returns the contents of the current selection as plain text.
====

[[cursor]]
== Cursors

Information about local and remote cursors is available:

====
https://github.com/ritzyed/ritzy/blob/master/src/ritzy.js#L343[Ritzy.getPosition]::
Returns the current position of the local cursor. The position is a character at which the cursor is placed
(the point just after the character), and an eolStart attribute. The eolStart attribute is when the position is
at the character at the end of a line (will generally be space if it is a soft break, and a newline if it is a
hard break), if eolStart is false the cursor is at the end of the line with that character, and if eolStart is
true, the cursor is at the start of the next line. This is necessary because both cursor positions represent
the *same* character position.
====

====
https://github.com/ritzyed/ritzy/blob/master/src/ritzy.js#L353[Ritzy.getRemoteCursors]::
Gets all remote cursors currently active in the document. Each remote cursor has attributes such as name
('name'), the last update time ('ms'), and the remote position of the cursor.
====

represent the cursor in this editor. Updates remote cursors immediately.

Parameters:::
* userName The user name to set.

https://github.com/ritzyed/ritzy/blob/master/src/ritzy.js#L206[Ritzy.setFontSize]::
Sets the editor font size, and update the editor contents immediately to reflect this.

Parameters:::
* horizontal The horizontal (left-right) margins.
* vertical The vertical (top-bottom) margins.
